  <h2>Welcome to Custom Design’s LA</h2>

  <p>
    What began in 2021 as a simple idea — learning to cast metal and create meaningful pieces — has grown into a handcrafted jewelry brand built from the ground up in Del Rio, Texas.
  </p>

  <p>
    After years of designing, refining, and developing collections, 2026 marks the year this work is finally ready to be revealed and shared with the world. Every ring, charm, bracelet, and custom order that came before was a stepping stone to getting where we are today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Custom Design’s LA is more than jewelry. It is craftsmanship, story, and legacy woven into every piece. Thank you for being a part of this journey, Del Rio — and welcome to the rest of the world.
