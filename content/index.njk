  <h2>Welcome to Custom Design’s LA</h2>

  <p>
    What began in 2021 as a simple idea — learning to cast metal and create meaningful pieces — has grown into a handcrafted jewelry brand built from the ground up in Del Rio, Texas.
  </p>

  <p>
    After years of designing, refining, and developing collections, 2026 marks the year this work is finally ready to be revealed and shared with the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Custom Design’s LA is more than jewelry. It is craftsmanship, story, and legacy woven into every piece.
