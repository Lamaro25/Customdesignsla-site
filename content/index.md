  <h2>Welcome to Custom Design’s LA</h2>

  <p>
    What began in 2021 as a simple idea — learning to cast metal and create meaningful pieces —
    has grown into a handcrafted jewelry brand built from the ground up in Del Rio, Texas.
  </p>

  <p>
    After years of designing, refining, and developing collections, 2025 marks the year this
    work is finally ready to be shared with the world. Every ring, charm, bracelet, and custom
    order is made with intention, sculpted by hand, and brought to life with the highest level
    of care.
  </p>

  <p>
    Custom Design’s LA is more than jewelry — it is craftsmanship, story, and legacy woven into
    every piece. Thank you for being part of this journey.
