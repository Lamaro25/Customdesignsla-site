    <h1>Our Custom Journey</h1>

    <p>
      Presented here are <strong>28 custom pieces</strong> created between
      <strong>2021 and today</strong> — a living archive of our growth,
      our learning, and our craft.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some pieces come from the early days, when we were first learning the art.
      Others reflect where we are now — refined, intentional, and evolving.
    </p>

    <p>
      This gallery will continue to change as new custom work is created.
    </p>
