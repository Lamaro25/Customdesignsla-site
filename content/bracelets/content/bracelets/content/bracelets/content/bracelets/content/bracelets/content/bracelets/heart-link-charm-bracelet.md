**Heart Link Charm Bracelet**  

A celebration of love and craftsmanship — this 9 mm heart-link chain is sculpted from solid .925 sterling silver, each open heart formed from round wire and polished to a brilliant finish. Elegant worn alone, yet perfect for attaching charms and pendants for a custom touch.  

Each bracelet is completed with the **CDLA Honeycomb Hallmark Tag**, a small bronze maker’s mark proudly designed and cast in Del Rio, Texas, representing authenticity and artistry.
