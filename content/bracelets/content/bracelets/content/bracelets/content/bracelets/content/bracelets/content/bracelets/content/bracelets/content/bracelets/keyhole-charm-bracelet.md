**Keyhole Charm Bracelet**

This sleek sterling silver bracelet combines strength and elegance through its long keyhole-shaped links joined by smaller round connectors. Each section reflects the light for a balanced, minimal look that transitions effortlessly from daywear to evening style.  

The design draws inspiration from vintage long-and-short chains, blending heritage craftsmanship with modern refinement. Ideal on its own or adorned with a charm from our collection, this bracelet celebrates both precision and artistry.  

A small **bronze honeycomb hallmark tag** featuring our maker’s mark, *Custom Designs LA*, rests near the clasp—symbolizing authenticity and craftsmanship.
