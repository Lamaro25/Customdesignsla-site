**Twin Cable Charm Bracelet**  

This handcrafted double-cable bracelet weaves two dapped sterling silver chains into one dynamic design. Each 7 mm link is flattened along its edges to catch the light, adding subtle brilliance and refined movement. Perfect for attaching select charms or wearing as a bold standalone statement.  

Every bracelet includes our signature **CDLA Honeycomb Hallmark Tag** — a 10.5 × 11 × 2.44 mm bronze maker’s mark proudly designed and cast in Del Rio, Texas, representing authenticity, origin, and artistry.
