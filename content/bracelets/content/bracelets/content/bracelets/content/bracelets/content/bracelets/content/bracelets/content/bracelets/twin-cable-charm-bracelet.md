**Twin Cable Charm Bracelet**  

A layered masterpiece — two dapped sterling silver cable chains intertwined in harmony, each link carefully flattened to capture light from every angle. Its sculpted double-chain design balances boldness and elegance, ready to hold charms or shine all on its own.  

Finished with CDLA’s **bronze Honeycomb Hallmark Tag**, designed and cast in Del Rio, Texas — a signature symbol of handcrafted authenticity and local artistry.
