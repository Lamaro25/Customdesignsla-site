**Hammered Oval Charm Bracelet**  

Each 3 mm hammered oval link of this bracelet reflects the artistry of handcrafted texture â€” shimmering subtly with every movement. Forged in solid .925 sterling silver and fine-silver plated for lasting brilliance, this piece is ideal for layering or adorning with meaningful charms.  

Finished with our **CDLA Honeycomb Hallmark Tag**, cast in bronze and hand-polished in Del Rio, Texas, symbolizing craftsmanship and authenticity.
