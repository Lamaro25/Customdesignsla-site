## Overview

The **Damascus Cuff (10 mm)** is hand-cast in solid .925 sterling silver and defined by its organic Damascus-style surface texture. Rather than a carved pattern, the design relies on natural flow and depth, creating a bold, raw aesthetic with strong visual character.

The wider 10 mm profile delivers substantial presence while maintaining a comfortable, wearable balance on the wrist.

Each cuff is individually finished, allowing subtle variations that highlight the handcrafted process.

**Total: $266 USD**
