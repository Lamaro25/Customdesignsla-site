## Overview

The **Cuban Link Cuff (10 mm)** is hand-cast in solid .925 sterling silver and defined by its bold Cuban link braid pattern. Deep oxidized channels add depth and contrast, while polished raised surfaces deliver a strong, refined finish.

The wider 10 mm profile provides substantial presence while maintaining a comfortable, wearable balance on the wrist.

Each cuff is individually finished, allowing subtle variations that highlight the handcrafted process.
