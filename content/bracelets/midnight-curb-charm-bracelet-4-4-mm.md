**Midnight Curb Charm Bracelet**  

Cast in solid .925 sterling silver, this bold 4.4 mm curb chain merges strength with refined elegance. Each interlocking link is precision-polished, oxidized, and hand-finished to accentuate its sculpted texture and depth. Designed for daily wear or as a foundation for custom charm arrangements that tell your story.  

Each bracelet features our signature **CDLA Honeycomb Hallmark Tag** — a 10.5 × 11 × 2.44 mm bronze maker’s mark cast in Del Rio, Texas — a symbol of craftsmanship and authenticity from Custom Designs LA.
