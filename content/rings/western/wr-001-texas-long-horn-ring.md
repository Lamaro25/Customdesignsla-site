description: >
  Forged in tribute to the Lone Star State, the Texas Long Horn Ring captures the unmistakable 
  strength and identity of Texas culture. Sculpted on a 7 mm flat band, the ring features a central 
  longhorn emblem framed by two raised rope braids and a single recessed channel. The Texas flag 
  wraps continuously around the band in raised relief—symbolizing unity, grit, and pride. Finished 
  with CDLA’s oxidized patina and polished by hand.
