description: >
  Forged in tribute to the Lone Star State, the Texas Long Horn Ring captures the
  unmistakable strength and identity of Texas culture. Sculpted on a 7 mm flat band,
  it features a central longhorn emblem framed by raised rope braids and a recessed
  channel. A continuous Texas flag wrap symbolizes unity, grit, and pride.
