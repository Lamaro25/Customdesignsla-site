  Every side tells a story of Texas. Sculpted fully in raised relief, the 
  **A Day in Texas Ring** brings two iconic scenes to life — the hunt and the 
  rodeo — divided by a central Lone Star. A custom embossed name panel rises 
  from the metal, making the ring uniquely yours. Cast in .925 sterling silver 
  with CDLA’s signature oxidized patina, every detail stands proud: rope edge, 
  star, hoof, and motion.
