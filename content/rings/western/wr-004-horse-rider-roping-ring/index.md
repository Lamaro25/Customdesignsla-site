  A tribute to the working cowboy and the legacy he leaves behind. The Horse
  Rider Roping Ring captures the heart of Western tradition — grit, motion,
  and craftsmanship — sculpted in raised relief on a 7 mm domed band.
  A cowboy roping a steer stretches across the center, framed by recessed
  channels and textured rope braids. Finished in oxidized .925 silver for
  contrast and depth.
