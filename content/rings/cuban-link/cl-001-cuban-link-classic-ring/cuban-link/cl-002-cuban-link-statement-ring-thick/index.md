  The Cuban Link Statement Ring (Thick) is the boldest piece in the entire
  collection—a heavy 10 mm domed band featuring a raised name-plate engraving
  panel, framed by three precision channels: one large Cuban braid and two
  smaller braids. High-polish edges against oxidized depth give it a sculptural,
  powerful presence. Cast & finished in Del Rio, Texas.
