  The Statement Ring (Thin) carries the same bold design language as the Thick
  version, but with a lighter, more comfortable weight. A 10 mm domed band 
  features a centered engraving panel framed by three channels: a large Cuban 
  braid and two smaller braids. Ideal for daily wear with full Statement energy.
