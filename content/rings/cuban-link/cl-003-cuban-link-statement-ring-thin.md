description: >
  The Statement Ring (Thin) carries the same bold Cuban Link design language as
  its Thick counterpart, refined into a lighter, more wearable form. A 10 mm
  domed profile features a centered engraving panel framed by three sculpted
  channels—one large Cuban braid flanked by two smaller braids—delivering full
  statement presence with improved everyday comfort.
