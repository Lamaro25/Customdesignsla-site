  The Twin Ring delivers symmetry and refined detail through a 7 mm domed band
  divided into two sculpted Cuban braids, separated by a clean central ridge.
  Diamond-pattern etched outer walls add depth and texture, while polished edges
  and oxidized recesses create crisp contrast. A balanced Cuban Link design,
  hand-cast and finished in Del Rio, Texas.
