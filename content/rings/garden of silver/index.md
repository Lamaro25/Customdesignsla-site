<h1>Garden of Silver</h1>

<p><em>Where nature meets silver.</em></p>

<p>
The Garden of Silver collection is the first AI-assisted ring series created for CDLA. Each design is inspired by the beauty found in nature — delicate flowers, winding vines, and organic textures that feel alive in metal. These rings are sculpted to reflect growth, movement, and the quiet elegance of the natural world.
</p>

<p>
Every piece is cast in solid .925 sterling silver and finished by hand, blending modern design technology with traditional craftsmanship. This collection celebrates nature not as a pattern, but as a living form captured in silver.
