description: >
  The Cuban Link Statement Ring (Thick) is the boldest piece in the entire
  collection. A heavy 10 mm domed band with a raised name-plate engraving panel,
  surrounded by three precision channels: a large Cuban braid core flanked by
  two smaller Cuban braids. Polished edges and oxidized recesses give the ring
  sculptural depth and a powerful presence. This is the flagship Cuban Link
  statement model — designed, cast, and finished in Del Rio, Texas.
