  The Statement Ring (Thin) carries the same bold design language as the Thick
  edition, but with a lighter, more wearable weight. The 10 mm domed band features
  a centered engraving panel framed by three precision channels: a large Cuban link
  braid and two smaller braids. Ideal for daily wear with full Statement presence.
