  The Statement Ring (Thin) carries the same bold design language as the Thick version,
  but with a lighter, more comfortable weight. A 10 mm domed band features a centered
  engraving panel framed by three channels: a large Cuban braid and two smaller braids.
  Ideal for daily wear with full Statement presence.
