  Rooted in community, courage, and devotion, the ACTS Ring was originally created for
  the Teen ACTS Retreat of 2023 at St. Joseph’s Church in Del Rio, Texas. Inside, the
  scripture Matthew 14:27 is engraved in full:
  “Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.”
  The exterior features the ACTS emblem and the Fisher of Men symbol, honoring the
  retreat pillars: Adoration, Community, Theology, and Service.
