  The Cross of Tomorrow Ring carries the message of peace beyond worry. A raised 
  continuous cross wraps around the exterior of the 7 mm domed band, symbolizing 
  protection encircling the wearer. Inside, Matthew 6:34 is engraved in full:
  “Do not worry about tomorrow; tomorrow will take care of itself. Sufficient for a day is its own evil.”
