description: >
  The Tree of Faith Ring draws its symbolism from endurance, growth, and the living
  nature of the cross. Carved on a slender custom 3 mm band that rises to a 7 mm
  cross peak, the band features a recessed wood-grain texture representing the 
  spirit of perseverance and spiritual rootedness. Inside is engraved Romans 12:12:
  “Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.”
